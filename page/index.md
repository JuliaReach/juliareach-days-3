\begin{section}{title="JuliaReach & JuliaIntervals Days 3", name="Welcome"}

\lead{**Welcome!**}

This event will host talks from two Julia communities: [JuliaReach](https://github.com/JuliaReach) (reachability analysis)
and [JuliaIntervals](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals) (interval methods). The main goal is to bring together people
interested in foundations or applications of these topics by: disseminating
the current state of relevant Julia packages, organising development sprints and exchanging
ideas or discussing open problems.

The event will take place from **9th to 11th December 2021, fully online**.
Connection details will be sent upon registration.

\lead{**Registration**}

The event is free, but registration is required. Optionally, participants' information will be
displayed in the [world map of the Participants](#participants) section in this webpage.

\lead{**Code of Conduct**}

*During the event, we will follow the [JuliaCon code of conduct](https://juliacon.org/2021/coc/).
Violations of code of conduct can be reported to `mforets [at] gmail [dot] com` and/or `luca [dot] ferranti [at] uwasa [dot] fi`.*

|:---|:---:|:---:|
|14h00 -- 14h20 |*Opening*| Marcelo Forets and Luca Ferranti|
|14h20 -- 15h00|**Talk 1:** *Overview of JuliaReach* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>TBA</details>|Marcelo Forets|
|15h00 -- 15h30|**Talk 2:** *Synthesis of hybrid automata from time-series data*<details><summary>Abstract</summary>A time series is a sequence of data points, each associated with a point in time. A hybrid automaton is a mathematical model of continuous dynamical systems with multiple operational modes. We present recent online and offline approaches to synthesize a hybrid automaton from a set of time series based on reachability analysis.</details>|Miriam Garc√≠a Soto|
|15h30 -- 16h00|**Talk 3:** *Exploring synergies between a proof and reachability based hybrid system verification* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This talk presents a joint work on integrating JuliaReach and reachability analysis into a refinement and proof-based system modelling and verification framework - Event-B. In particular, the talk attempts to demonstrate how reachability analysis can help to increase the verification automation of the hybrid system development in Event-B. </details>| Paulius Stankaitis|
|16h00 -- 17h00|**Break**| üçï |
|17h00 -- 17h20 | **Challenge Problem 1:** *Platoon of unicycle vehicles* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider a platoon of unicycle vehicles where the i-th vehicle follows the (i-1)-th  and the relative displacements between the vehicles are controlled by a state-dependent feedback. The challenge is to verify a time-dependent safety constraint on the lateral distance between the vehicles as well as a safety bound on the horizontal displacements.</details>|Arvind Adimoolam|
|17h20 -- 17h40 | **Challenge Problem 2:** *Robust control problem by scenario optimization* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>TBA</details>|Roberto Rocchetta|
|17h40 -- 18h00|**Challenge Problem 3:** *A nonlinear truss structural dynamics problem using reachability analysis* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this challenge, a simple truss-structure linear/nonlinear dynamics problem will be presented, where in the nonlinear case, large displacements are considered [[1]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ONSAS/libroANLE/main/tex/libroANLE.pdf#subsection.4.3.1). Basic Finite Element Method and Solid Dynamics concepts will be exposed, as well as the gold-standard numerical integration techniques. The recent application of Reachability Analysis to the linear case will be recalled [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05841.pdf). The numerical results for the linear case using numerical integration and reachability will be obtained. Finally the nonlinear case problem will be clearly posed allowing to discuss possible novel approaches using reachability analysis.</details>|Jorge P√©rez Zerpa|
|18h00 -- 18h20 | **Challenge Problem 4:**  *Nonlinear model of F16 flight dynamics* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>TBA</details>| Raktim Bhattacharya|

|:----|:----:|:--------:|
|13h00 -- 13h30|**Talk 4:** *Using Intersection of Unions to Minimize Multi-directional Linearization Error in Reachability Analysis* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Given an initial set of a nonlinear system with uncertain parameters and inputs, the set of states that can possibly be reached is computed. The approach is based on local linearizations of the nonlinear system, while linearization errors are considered by Lagrange remainders. These errors are added as uncertain inputs, such that the reachable set of the locally linearized system encloses the one of the original system. The linearization error is controlled by splitting of reachable sets. Reachable sets are represented by zonotopes, allowing an efficient computation in relatively high-dimensional space. </details>|Arvind Adimoolam|
|13h30 -- 14h00 | **Talk 5:** *Soft-constrained interval predictor models and epistemic reliability intervals: A new tool for uncertainty quantification with limited experimental data* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>TBA</details>|Roberto Rocchetta|
|14h00 -- 16h00 |**Talk 6:** *Overview of JuliaIntervals* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This talk will give an overview of the packages inside the JuliaIntervals organisation, focusing on their current status, limitations and development. The talk will also give a general overview of interval arithmetic and the IEEE 1788-2015 standard for it. This will set grounds for discussion in the round table after the break. </details>|Luis Benet, Luca Ferranti, David Sanders|
|16h00 -- 17h00 |**Break**|üçï|
|17h00 -- 19h00|**Round table:** *JuliaIntervals status and roadmap* <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This will be an opportunity for everyone interested in the JuliaIntervals ecosystem to discuss about the current status of the organisation and brainstorm ideas for further development. Particular emphasis will be given to IntervalArithmetic.jl roadmap towards version 1.0.</details>|everyone willing to discuss|
