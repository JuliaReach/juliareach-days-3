\begin{section}{title="JuliaReach days 3", name="About"}

\lead{Welcome to the third edition of JuliaReach days!}

The purpose of this event is to bring together people working on reachability analysis (or people interested in such) to exchange ideas, share results and network with new potential colleagues.

JuliaReach days 3 will be on **9th and 10th December 2021, fully online**, (connection details coming soon).

During the event, we will follow the [JuliaCon code of conduct](https://juliacon.org/2021/coc/). Violations of code of conduct can be reported to `mforets [at] gmail [dot] com` and/or `luca [dot] ferranti [at] uwasa [dot] fi`

- **Track**: Applications (9th December)
- **Title**: *Exploring synergies between a proof and reachability based hybrid system verification*\\
- **Abstract**: This talk presents a joint work on integrating JuliaReach and reachability analysis into a refinement and proof-based system modelling and verification framework - Event-B. In particular, the talk attempts to demonstrate how reachability analysis can help to increase the verification automation of the hybrid system development in Event-B. 
- **Bio**: Paulius Stankaitis is a Research Associate and member of Advanced Model-Based Engineering and Reasoning research group at Newcastle University (Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom). His research focuses on the development of formal techniques for modelling and verification of safe cyber-physical systems. Prior to the postdoctoral position, Paulius worked on a formal verification of railway signalling systems.
