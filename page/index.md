\begin{section}{title="JuliaReach Days 3", name="Welcome"}

\lead{Welcome to the third edition of JuliaReach Days!}

The purpose of this event is to bring together people working on reachability analysis
or people interested in such, to exchange ideas, share results and discuss open problems.

JuliaReach days 3 will be between **9th and 11th December 2021, fully online**, with
connection details coming soon.

During the event, we will follow the [JuliaCon code of conduct](https://juliacon.org/2021/coc/).

- **Track**: Foundations (10th December)
- **Title**: *Soft-constrained interval predictor models and epistemic reliability intervals: A new tool for uncertainty quantification with limited experimental data*
- **Abstract**:
- **Bio**:  Dr Roberto Rocchetta works as a post-doc at the department for mathematics and computer science at the Technical University of Eindhoven on a collaborative project with Philips. He holds a Master in Energy Engineering from the University of Bologna, a Master of research in decision-making under risk and uncertainty from the University of Liverpool, and a PhD in reliability engineering, also from the University of Liverpool. His PhD thesis, defended in December 2018, dealt with several important aspects of uncertainty quantification and analysis of complex systems and critical infrastructures. Before joining the University of Eindhoven, he worked for one year at the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) in a joint project with NASA Langley. There he focused on the development of data-driven decision-making tools for reliability-based and risk-based design optimization. Rocchetta‚Äô s research is highly multidisciplinary and combines ideas from system reliability engineering, statistical learning theory, stochastic optimization, uncertainty quantification and machine learning.
